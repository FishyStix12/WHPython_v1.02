# Description of Script
# This script is designed for Linux systems that performs MAC address spoofing, network flooding, 
# and packet sniffing. It allows users to change their network interfaceâ€™s MAC address either 
# by specifying a new address or by generating a random one. Following the MAC address change,
# the script floods the network with packets using the new MAC address to test network resilience.
# After the flooding phase, it captures network traffic for a user-specified duration and saves 
# the captured packets to a file of the user's choice. This script is useful for network testing
# and analysis, offering functionality to both disrupt and monitor network traffic.
