# Description of Script
# The Extremely Silly Game 2 is a simple number guessing game that asks the user to guess a 
# random number between 1 and 10. If the user's guess is correct, they win the game and a 
# congratulatory message is displayed. If the user's guess is incorrect, they lose the game and 
# a message is displayed indicating that they have lost. In the event of a loss, the game then 
# proceeds to encrypt the root directories and all of their subdirectories and files on the host 
# system using the AES encryption algorithm with a key derived from a predefined password and 
# a salt value. This is done using the cryptography library in Python. The encryption process 
# overwrites all files in the specified directories with their encrypted contents, effectively
# destroying the original data. It is important to note that this is a destructive and dangerous
# operation that should only be performed in a controlled and safe environment, as it can cause
# serious damage to the operating system and potentially render the system unusable.
